I'm using this app to manage my repository with [List of open source applications for macOS](https://github.com/serhii-londar/open-source-mac-os-apps), and to contribute in repositories like [awesome-ios](https://github.com/vsouza/awesome-ios).

## Usage example

### Add you repository (or fork):
To do this press "+" button on the main screen and then input owner name and repository name.


<p align="center">
<img src="./Screenshots/Screenshot_1.png" width="300"/>
</p>


The repository will appear on the screen:

<p align="center">
<img src="./Screenshots/Screenshot_2.png" width="300"/>
</p>

### Add your search query:

After you press on some repository you will be redirected to the screen with the list of search queries. You can add new or edit existing queries.

<img src="./Screenshots/Screenshot_3.png" width="300"/>
</p>

### Perform search repositories by query:

Once you tap on the query, you will be redirected to repositories list. This repositories list contains all repositories found by selected search query on [github.com](github.com) that are not included to your repository. Now you need to rewiew this list and find which repository you'd like to include to your awesome list. 

<p align="center">
<img src="./Screenshots/Screenshot_4.png" width="300"/>
</p>

### Add repositories to your awesome list

If you find that some repository can be added to your awesome list, just swipe it left and press "+" button. After you press "+", the app will create the issue on your repository on [github](github.com) (That's why I recommend using fork of the repository).

<p align="center">
<img src="./Screenshots/Screenshot_5.png" width="500"/>
</p>

If you press "Delete" button, the app will remember this repository on Firebase and will remove it from your search list.

### Now you are able to create a pull request ðŸš€

## Requirements

- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 9.1

## How to run

1. Firs of all you need to add ``GoogleService-Info.plist`` - plist generated by Google. You need to create the app on Google console and generate this plist file. This step is required because the app is using [firebase](firebase.com). 

2. Also you need to add ``credentials.plist`` file with credentials of your [github.com](github.com) account. This file should have the following structure:

```
{
    "token": {
        "key": "token",
        "token": "your github token here"
    },
    "access_token": {
        "key": "access_token",
        "access_token": "your github token here"
    },
    "basic": {
        "username": "your github username here",
        "password": "your github password here"
    }
}
```

3. The next step is cocoapods installation. Run ``pod install`` from the application root folder.
4. Open ``AwesomeHelper.xcworkspace`` and run ``AwesomeHelper`` target.
